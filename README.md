Introduction to Building Lightweight Data Science Gateways and APIs in R 
========================================================================

**Date:** Tuesday, September 25, 2018  
**Time:** 9:00am - 5:00pm  
**Location:** Texas Advanced Computing Center, Austin, TX  
**Registration:** <a href="https://sciencegateways.org/web/gateways2018/attend/register">Registration</a>  

Abstract
========

The R language is used within the Data Science community as a pragmatic problem solving tool. While more general purpose languages like Python, Javascript, and PHP are often the choice of Science Gateway developers, R provides attractive options to enhance existing gateways with visualization, analytics, and data manipulation to rapidly construct independent gateways and REST APIs. In this 3 hour, hands-on tutorial, participants will begin with a brief introduction to R for data science, then receive a short primer on using the Agave Platform's R SDK to generate and share remote datasets. After the break, they will take the visualization and analysis examples from the first two sections and expose them as a small visualization gateway using Shiny and a secure REST API using OpenCPU and the Agave Platform.  

* **Content Level:** Introductory: 67%, Intermediate: 33%  
* **Audience:** developers, administrators, and enthusiasts from the gateways community interested in learning about some non-traditional ways that technologies common to the data analytics and data science community can be applied to science gateway projects to add value and functionality to more traditional science gateway technology stacks.  

* **Prerequisites:** Participants with some experience in web application development and scripting languages (R, Python, Javascript, PHP, etc.) will benefit the most. Users with R experience will find value in the Data Science notebooks and additional materials. Prior experience in R is NOT required.  
* **Required:** Participants must provide their own laptop, tablet, or the like with a modern web browser to access the training environment.
