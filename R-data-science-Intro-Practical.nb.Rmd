### Practical

- Start with a new R Notebook

- Read the file `intro_r_practical.tsv` located in the data folder into a new  DataFrame called `spending_practical_df`.
  
- Use an appropriate R method to display the first five lines of `spending_practical_df`


- How many rows and columns does the DataFrame contain?

- Write a statement that returns the `spending`  (column) of  `spending_practical_df`.

- Write a single statement that returns lines 1st, 5th  and 10th lines of `spending_practical_df`.

- Write a single statement that returns the columns `specialty` and `spending` for the rows with labels 12 and 21 of `spending_practical_df`.
```{r}
df <- read.csv("data/intro_r_practical.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
head(df)
dim(df)
df[c("spending")]
df[c(1,5,10),]
df[c(12,21),c("specialty","spending")]
```
